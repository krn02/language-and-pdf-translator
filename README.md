This project is a web-based **Language and PDF Translator** application, designed to efficiently convert both plain text and entire PDF documents.

The application has two core functionalities. First, the **Text Translator** module allows users to input text and translate it into a variety of languages, with options to swap the input and output fields and copy translated content. Second, the **PDF Translator** extracts text from uploaded PDF documents using the **PDF.js** library, translates the content in manageable chunks via the **MyMemory API**, and then formats the output for easy reading.

The project supports a wide range of languages including English, Spanish, French, German, and Arabic. The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a clean and professional user interface.
